# Home Automation Lab

## Objective

The Home Automation Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
- Installed VirtualBox on a Windows machine

- Created a Virtual Machine (VM), beginning with installing Windows 10.

- Installed Windows Server

- Installing Kali Linux 

- Confguired all system to run on an internal network

- Downloaded Sysmon and Configuration File: Sysmon from the Microsoft website 

- Obtained a configuration file from GitHub (created by Olaf), which I used to customize what Sysmon logs.

- Downloaded and Installed Splunk

- Configured Splunk

- setup monitoring event logs

- Created Malware using MSFVenmon

- Infected the Windows Server

- Used Splunk to traces all the steps
